1. in instances where we had to handle a collection of objects, we chose to use 
the Java Standard Library ArrayList implementation, as well as a HashMap in the 
Catalog. ArrayList comes with many handy methods that were perfect for our uses 
in the project--especially the concatenation function. 
2. We added an Iterator auxiliary class to HeapFile to hold the collection of 
methods required for the HeapFileIterator.
3. There are no incomplete or missing sections of code apart from those that 
will be implemented in future projects as dictated by the spec.
4. We spent 7 hours working on the project. It was hard to discern how to wire 
together the classes at a higher level when doing the SeqScan class. This was 
further muddled by all the static functions and classes. Also, Alex has never 
used Sun™ Java© so this was a fun adventure.
